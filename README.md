# Exercise 6

Not much to note in this question except for Problem #3:
```
key 10 - Here the user can input the value of the key he wants, in this case it's 10
re k - Read the key value the user wanted
re n - Read the next record
key n - Go to the next record
re n - Then Read the next key value
```
I belive that *re n* simply reads the next record and does nothing more so instead of doing two *re n* commands in a row, we need instead to go to the next record and then do the *re n* command.
